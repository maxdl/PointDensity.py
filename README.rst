===============

PointDensity.py is a software tool for analysis of immunogold labeled electron
micrographs. Specifically, it is used to analyse gold labeling associated with 
membrane-enclosed compartments or other closed segmented paths. It is of course
also possible to use the tool for other types of two-dimensional spatial point 
patterns.

PointDensity.py is used in conjunction with its companion ImageJ plugin,
PointDensity_.java.
