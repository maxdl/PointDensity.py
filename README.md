PointDensity.py
===============

This is a software tool for analysis of immunogold labeled electron micrographs.
Specifically, it is used to analyse gold labeling associated with membrane-
enclosed compartments or other closed segmented paths. It is of course also 
possible to use the tool for other types of two-dimensional spatial point 
patterns.

This tool is used in conjunction with its companion ImageJ plugin,
PointDensity_.java.
